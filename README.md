# Final Project: What's in my fridge?
The assignment was to build a project with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, using a MongoDB datamase. 

## My app
I have chosen to build a web app which aims to help reduce waste in the form of food which would have been forgotten about in the fridge and then thrown out. It is an app where you can register the items in your fridge with an expiry date and review all the content of your fridge sorted with the items expiring soon at the top, to give you time to use them instead of later throwing them out.
