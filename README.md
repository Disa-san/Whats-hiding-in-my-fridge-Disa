# Final Project: What's in my fridge?
The assignment was to build a project with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, using a MongoDB datamase. 

## My app
I have chosen to build a web app which aims to help reduce waste in the form of food and money. It is an app where you can register the items in your fridge with an expiry date and get a notification when something is about to expire, in time for you to use it instead of throwing it out. 

## View it live
